# Mutation Disequilibrium Analysis

## Analysis of microbial 16S sequences

These are controlled vi the `mdeqasis` command line tool. The following subcommands were run:

`filter-alignments` -> produces tinydb of 16S sequences after removing non nucleotide characters (including gaps)

`microbial-fit-gn` -> fits GN model to all microbial alignments

`microbial-gn-stats` -> extracts statistics for sampling the four seed alignments
